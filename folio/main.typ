= Overview
This document provides documentation for the Preliminary Object Oriented Programming
Project. The appendixes provide external documentation and context useful for those
studying the code.

== Hunt the Wumpus: Background

*Hunt the Wumpus* is a classic computer game originally created in 1972 by Gregory
Yob. The game is set in a series of interconnected caves, where the player must
hunt a creature known as the Wumpus. The player navigates the cave system,
avoiding hazards such as bottomless pits and super bats, while attempting to
deduce the Wumpus's location and shoot it to win the game.

== Wumpus: Network
*Wumpus: Network* is the result of this project. It is a game inspired by Hunt
the Wumpus, adding original features. It is a graphical game with 3D and 4D
levels, expanding the scope of the original game with more challenging and
interesting levels.
