# Software Engineering Preliminary HSC OOP Project

This was the year 11 Software Engineering OOP Project. See [Folio README.md](./folio/main.pdf) for the submitted documentation. Use of LLMs for code generation was allowed in this project.

This game implements a GUI Hunt the Wumpus game, using a graph-based view of the map. Levels are based on a perspective projection of wireframes from various 3D and 4D surfaces (See the appendix in the folio for more details).
